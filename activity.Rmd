## Descriptive statistics

**Descriptive statistics** summarize a dataset, commonly through measures of central tendency or spread

Examples: mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation

Descriptive statistics are usually used to set the stage for an analysis. You might use them to

-   describe a population
-   characterize a phenomenon

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example: The Five Number Summary**

The **five number summary** is commonly used to provide a basic description on a dataset. It usually contains

-   The minimum value
-   The lower quartile
-   The median
-   The upper quartile
-   The maximum value

**Note:** A five number summary can only be computed for quantitative variables (but qualitative variables can still be described statistically!)

::: {.right style="float:right;width:58%"}
```{r, echo = FALSE,comment = ''}
n_responders <- results %>% filter(type == "real") %>% distinct(Screen.name) %>%
  count() %>% pull(n)
n_responders_complete <- results %>% filter(type == "real") %>% count(Screen.name) %>% filter(n < 6) %>% nrow()

question1 <- results %>% 
  filter(type == "real") %>% 
  filter(question == question_text[1]) %>%
  pull(Response) %>% as.numeric()

question2 <- results %>% 
  filter(type == "real") %>% 
  filter(question == question_text[2]) %>%
  pull(Response) %>% as.numeric()

question3 <- results %>% 
  filter(type == "real") %>% 
  filter(question == question_text[3]) %>%
  pull(Response)
freq_table <- table(question3)
percent <- round(prop.table(freq_table), 2) * 100
dt <- cbind(freq_table , percent) %>% set_colnames(c("Count", "Percent (%)"))

```

**Summary of Survey Responses**

`r n_responders` people responded

`r n_responders_complete` people didn't answer every question `r emo::ji("face")`

`r question_text[1]`

```{r, echo = FALSE, comment = ''}
summary(question1)
```

`r question_text[2]`

```{r, echo = FALSE, comment = ''}
summary(question2)
```

`r question_text[3]`

```{r, echo = FALSE, comment = ''}
dt
```

## Descriptive statistics

-   Sometimes descriptive statistics are all that's needed
-   Descriptive statistics can hide important patterns in a dataset
    -   Exploratory data visualization is always encouraged!

## Inferential Statistics

**Inferential statistics** allow us to draw conclusions based on a dataset based on **probability theory**

Examples: T test, Chi-squared test, ANOVA, regression

Inferential statistics are usually used to test a hypothesis, for example

-   Estimate a characteristic of a population using characteristics of a subset of the population

-   Understand connections between variables

-   Forecast future outcomes based on historical data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.left style="float:left;width:38%"}
**Example: Correlation**

A **correlation** describes the relationship between two variables

-   "Correlation does not equal causation"

There are many methods of calculate correlation coefficient, but generally

-   correlation ranges between 0 and 1 (1 means perfect relationship)
-   the sign of the coefficient (positive or negative) is the direction of the relationship

## Statistical Significance

**Statistical significance** demonstrates the degree to which a result can be attributed to random chance

Low P value (0.5, 0.1) means low likelihood results are due to random chance alone

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.left style="float:left;width:38%"}
**Example: Regression**

**Regression analysis** is a family of methods to characterize the relationship between an outcome of interest and explanatory variables

\- **Most common regression method is linear regression**

Rules of thumb for explanatory variables

-   Regression requires quantitative (numeric) inputs, but qualitative (categorical) inputs can be coded

    -   "Dummy" variables

-   Too many explanatory variables hurts model performance

-   Explanatory variables should not be correlated

  stat_poly_eq(aes(label =  paste(after_stat(eq.label), "*\" with \"*", 
                                  after_stat(p.value.label), "*\"\"",
                                  sep = "")), size = 5, color = "dark green")

::: {.left style="float:left;width:38%"}
**Example: chi-squared test**

A **chi-squared** test is used to analyze if two categorical variables are related
-   Also called a chi-squared test of independence

The intuition is to see if actual frequencies match up with expected frequencies

:::

::: {.right style="float:right;width:58%"}
**Is there a relationship between personality and movie preferences?**

```{r, echo = FALSE,comment = '', warning = FALSE}
chi_results <- dplyr::filter(results, question == "Are you a..." | question == "What's the best movie genre?") %>% pivot_wider(names_from = question, values_from = Response)

table(chi_results$`What's the best movie genre?`, chi_results$`Are you a...`)
table <- table(chi_results$`What's the best movie genre?`, chi_results$`Are you a...`)
print(chisq.test(table))
```

## Statistical significance

-   No statistical significance does not mean ‘bad’ results
    -   Methodological or data concerns?
    -   What is interesting about theory not matching up with analysis?
-   Statistical significance does not necessarily mean real-world significance
